# 2026-02-13 - Bright Engine Build Session

## Session Context
- **Project:** Bright Automations Platform - home services lead gen/website builder
- **Task:** Resume MASTER_BUILD_BLUEPRINT.md from Phase 3 Step 17
- **Status:** Andrew confirmed Phase 1 & 2 complete, continue from Phase 3

## Progress Made
**Phase 3 Complete (22/51 bugs fixed)**

### Steps Completed:
- **Step 17:** Remove stub workers - **Already clean** (queue.ts only had queue definitions)
- **Step 18:** Create missing lib modules - **Already existed** (preview-generator.ts, rep-scripts.ts, distribution.ts all implemented)
- **Step 19:** Add missing workers - **Already done** (all 7 workers implemented in index.ts)
- **Step 20:** Event-driven chaining - **Already working** (enrichment → preview → personalization → scripts → distribution)
- **Step 21:** **FIXED** import processing UI crash (replaced broken pipelineState.step1.status with proper data)
- **Step 22:** **IMPLEMENTED** graceful Redis check wrapper around worker startup

### Key Findings:
- Most Phase 3 infrastructure was already implemented
- Import page crash was the main blocker (fixed)
- Workers have proper chaining and error handling
- Redis gracefully degrades when unavailable

### Build Status:
- ✅ TypeScript compiles clean
- ✅ `npm run build` succeeds  
- ✅ Deployed to main branch
- 📊 Progress: 22/51 bugs fixed

## Next Steps
**Phase 4:** Price fixes + UI wiring (Steps 23-31)
- Fix all $299 → $149 pricing
- Wire up dead buttons (status dropdown, Call Now, Send SMS)
- Fix mobile sidebar responsiveness
- Calculate actual rep performance stats

## Technical Notes
- Worker architecture: 7 workers (enrichment, preview, personalization, scripts, distribution, sequence, monitoring)
- Pipeline: Event-driven chaining prevents timing issues
- Redis: Graceful fallback when unavailable
- Import UI: Now shows actual data vs hardcoded values

## Session Quality
**Excellent** - Found most work was already done, focused on the actual bugs, made solid progress. Ready to continue Phase 4 efficiently.
